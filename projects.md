* [Undertale Multiverse](https://github.com/Sixthhokage1/undertale-multiverse):
  An exercise in using Git branches to keep Undertale save files in their own timelines, because it's thematically appropriate. Something I need to return to.
* [PEFEgon](https://github.com/Sixthhokage1/PEFEgon):
  Fork of the Bastion Discord bot that I maintain for a server I help moderate. Differs very little from upstream, mostly has a public GH repo for transparency of what code's being run on the server.
