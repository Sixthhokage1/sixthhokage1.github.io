* [PEFEgon](https://github.com/Sixthhokage1/PEFEgon):
  Fork of the Bastion Discord bot that I maintain for a server I help moderate. Differs very little from the pre-v8 upstream, mostly has a public GH repo for transparency of what code's being run on the server.
* [WAAPT Wiki](https://waapt.wiki.tropi.us/wiki/Main_Page):
  I manage the backend of the wiki for the *We Are All Pok√©mon Trainers* roleplay.
* [Jubilife Global Terminal](https://jubi.life/about):
  A fediverse server based on the glitch-soc/mastodon fork.
* [kobopatch-conf](https://elmlab.xyz/Sixthhokage1/kobopatch-conf):
  Configs for customization of my Kobo ereader, mostly using Patrick Gaskin's [Kobopatch](https://pgaskin.net/kobopatch-patches/) to customize the Nickel system software
* Homestuck projects listed on my [goldenrodResearcher](https://goldenrodResearcher.com/) site
